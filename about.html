                    <h2>Curious about me? Here you have it:</h2>
                    <p>I'm currently studying at the American University of Armenia, pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I am deeply interested in AI and even have my own idea for an AI language model. I have extensive volunteer experience with the European Youth Parliament (EYP), Armenian Red Cross, and AGBU Armenia.</p>
                    <p>In terms of work experience, I've worked as a waiter and sales manager, and I've completed an internship at Instigate. I'm always looking to learn and grow in my field, and I enjoy taking on new challenges.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I'm available for freelance work, so feel free to reach out and say hello! I promise I don't bite ðŸ˜Š</p>
